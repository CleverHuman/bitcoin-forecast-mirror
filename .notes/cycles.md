For each halving cycle:
	1.	Use halving dates
	2.	Use actual BTC prices
	3.	Measure:
	•	📈 run-up before halving (low → pre-halving high)
	•	📉 drawdown after halving (high → post-halving low)
	•	⏱️ duration (days up / days down)
	4.	Average across cycles
	5.	Use those averages to:
	•	parameterise Prophet windows or
	•	sanity-check Prophet output

This keeps your model data-driven, not narrative-driven.
